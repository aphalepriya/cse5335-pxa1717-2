CSE 5335 PROJECT 2
==================

###What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
The project is based on previous project with additional features like Database. The uploading of the project in git and deployment in Heroku was easy because it was similar to previous project.

###What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
Integration of Rails with Jquery was hard since this is my first project on Jquery because I had used angularjs last time. Also, learning Postgresql was an additional thing that was to be done and to understand its integration with heroku was new.

###If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest concern?
Using these technologies professionally will have concerens like code standards and access rights. For example, the access to database is usually restricted to each region. Hence, additional handling of authorization would be needed.
